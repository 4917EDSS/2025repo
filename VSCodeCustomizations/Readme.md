#VS Code Customizations
Run the .bat file in this folder to copy the files from this folder to the FRC VS Code installation folder.

It's assumed that VS Code is installed for all users (i.e. in C:\Users\Public).

Key customizations:
- CTRL+B to build robot code
- Don't show parameter inlays
- Use the 4917 style for auto-formatting files (SHIFT+ALT+F)
